# Data Structures

### Summary

This repository is a study of various data structures based on Luis Joyanes Aguilar's book "Fundamentos de Programaci√≥n" or "Programming Fundamentals" in English, and on the Udemy course "JavaScript Algorthims and Data Structures Masterclass"

It will have some sort explanation, as it is intended to be a practical guide for its practice. This repository has examples in my mine three languages: C#, JavaScript and Python
